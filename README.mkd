## Algorithms
Repository with a collection of algorithms

### How to Run
```
$ ruby algorithm.rb
```

With this will open the IRB on your console

### Run the Floyd algorithm
```
irb(main):001:0> Algorithm.floyd
```

Or informing the file with the graph

```
irb(main):001:0> Algorithm.floyd path_file/graph.txt
```
> The file with the graph should have the format:
> 
> AB5, BC4, CD8, DC8, DE6, AD5, CE2, EB3, AE7
> 
> where A and B are vertices and 5 is the edge weight
